import xml pyhton library
import sqlite3 pyhton library
create database file 
create a cursor to use in program

by using the cursor we would create tables using sql
     drop tables
     create table 
     create table
     create table
     
open xml file from which we will get data for database

create program which will fetch data from xml file

then parse the xml file

go to the branch where data are located
count the number of branch which have data

start a loop which would iterate every data branch of of xml file
      take those data into their respective attributes
      print their value
      then insert those value into the tables
commit
